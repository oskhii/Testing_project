## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
    I think this project was really good to get a better understanding of how software testing really works. So far it had only been theoretical and I often learn better by actually doing things, so this was really helpful and made me more interested in the topic too. 

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- 
    I explored the website and thought of different scenarios to test. I then wrote them on my text editor one by one in an concise and understandable way. I then executed the test cases one by one. 

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management
 -     
    I did not use any other tools than there were recommended or specified in the project instructions. 

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
    I used Visual Studio Code. I had already used it on another course this autumn so I was familiar with it and had it installed and connected to my GitHub already which was handy since Visual Studio Code was the recommended program to use. 
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- 
    I had some trouble to get going at first but after watching the recorded Zoom meetings again (Which I really like to have available), I got the hang of it. The instructions were really good even though I was a bit confused at first. On GitLab I had some trouble finding some functionalities but I solved them easily by a quick Google search.       

## 6. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)
- 
    I do not really know which I would use and I do not as of now have plans to do that but who knows, maybe some time in the future. 

## 7. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
    Experience in working with testing, passion for testing, analytical skills, problem solving, working in a team, outside the box thinking, self-motivated, knowledge of test techniques and methods, Robot framework, Jenkins, GIT, Python, SQL, Java, Appium, BS/MS degree in for example Computer Science, Engineering or Information Technology

## 8. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
    I would have to learn a lot more about the frameworks and required languages as well as more about software testing as a whole. I would also need to work on working in a team.

## 9. Are you going to apply for ISTQB Foundation level Certification?
- 
    I am not going to apply for the certification, at least as of now.
